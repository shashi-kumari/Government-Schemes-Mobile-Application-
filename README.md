## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 8 or higher
- Android SDK with API 23+ support
- Firebase project setup (for authentication and database)

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
3. Download the `google-services.json` file
4. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory
5. Enable Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication in the Firebase console
6. Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashi-kumari/Government-Schemes-Mobile-Application-.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Ensure `google-services.json` is properly placed in the `app/` directory
4. Sync project with Gradle files
5. Build and run the application

### App Usage

1. **Registration**: New users can sign up with their details
2. **Login**: Existing users can log in with their credentials
3. **Browse Schemes**: Select from six different scheme categories
4. **View Details**: Tap on any category to view detailed scheme information
5. **Notifications**: Subscribe to get notified about new schemes and updates

## Scheme Data Structure

The application uses XML files stored in the `assets` folder to provide scheme information. Each sector has its own XML file containing:

- **SCHEME**: Name of the government scheme

4. **Education** (`education.xml`) - Educational scholarships, grants, and academic support schemes
5. **Health** (`health.xml`) - Healthcare schemes, medical assistance, and wellness programs
6. **Housing** (`housing.xml`) - Housing schemes, infrastructure development, and shelter programs

## Architecture

The application follows a simple activity-based architecture:

- **Authentication Flow**: Login → Signup → Main Dashboard
- **Main Dashboard**: Category selection with navigation to specific scheme activities
- **Scheme Activities**: XML parsing and display of scheme information
- **Data Layer**: Firebase for user data, XML assets for scheme information
- **Notification Service**: Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
